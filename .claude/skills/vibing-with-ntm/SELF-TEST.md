# Self-Test — Trigger Phrases for /vibing-with-ntm

Validate that the skill's description reliably triggers on realistic operator phrasings. For each phrase below, the skill should be chosen over sibling skills (`/ntm`, `/agent-mail`, `/beads-br`, `/beads-bv`, `/caam`).

## Should Trigger (operator context, tending verbs, recovery signals)

- "tend the swarm on asupersync"
- "babysit my NTM session for an hour"
- "run an orchestrator tick on myproject"
- "one of my cc panes has been stuck for 3 ticks, what do I do"
- "pane 4 is rate-limited — how do I rotate without losing its bead"
- "send marching orders to every pane in the session"
- "my codex panes look wedged, multi-line prompts aren't submitting"
- "how do I know when to stop the swarm / detect convergence"
- "flip my swarm into review-only mode"
- "dispatch the ship-or-surface prompt"
- "ready queue is empty, should I ideate new beads or stop"
- "before bulk-assigning the swarm, check if RCH or quota is saturated"
- "my prompt landed in the wrong pane after a restart"
- "dcg check doesn't exist anymore, what should the orchestrator use"
- "close the backlog — beads are ballooning past 200"
- "agents keep filing review beads but never closing them"
- "how do I safely restart a pane without losing in-flight work"
- "the orchestrator loop for tending cc/cod/gmi panes"
- "an agent keeps writing prose but never commits"
- "I ran --robot-restart-pane but the agent never came back"
- "disk is climbing 3% per tick, what's the right intervention"
- "tmux send-keys lands as a zsh command-not-found"

## Should NOT Trigger (adjacent but wrong skill)

| Phrase | Correct skill |
| --- | --- |
| "what does `ntm --robot-snapshot` return" | `/ntm` |
| "register a new MCP Agent Mail identity" | `/agent-mail` |
| "br ready is returning empty but I know work exists" | `/beads-br` or `/fixing-beads-problems` |
| "compute betweenness centrality on my bead graph" | `/beads-bv` |
| "add a new Claude Max account to CAAM" | `/caam` |
| "which Gemini model does the review swarm use" | `/code-review-gemini-swarm-with-ntm` |
| "provision a fresh Ubuntu box for agents" | `/provision-new-machine` |

## Validator

After any edit to the skill's `description:` or decision tree, run these phrases through the skill-selection flow and confirm:

1. Every "should trigger" phrase selects `/vibing-with-ntm` (or /vibing-with-ntm alongside a sibling — both is fine if the sibling also fires).
2. Every "should NOT trigger" phrase selects the correct sibling first, with /vibing-with-ntm not in the top match.
3. Description still satisfies skill-authoring rules: third-person, ≤200 chars preferred (≤250 acceptable given scope), front-loaded triggers, explicit "Use when" clause.
