# Ralph TUI - Create JSON Tasks

Converts PRDs to prd.json format for ralph-tui autonomous execution.

> **Note:** This skill is bundled with ralph-tui's JSON tracker plugin. Future tracker plugins (Linear, GitHub Issues, etc.) will bundle their own task creation skills.

---

## The Job

Take a PRD (markdown file or text) and create a prd.json file:
1. **Extract Quality Gates** from the PRD's "Quality Gates" section
2. Parse user stories from the PRD
3. Append quality gates to each story's acceptance criteria
4. Set up dependencies between stories
5. Output ready for `ralph-tui run --prd <path>`

---

## Step 1: Extract Quality Gates

Look for the "Quality Gates" section in the PRD:

```markdown
## Quality Gates

These commands must pass for every user story:
- `pnpm typecheck` - Type checking
- `pnpm lint` - Linting

For UI stories, also include:
- Verify in browser using dev-browser skill
```

Extract:
- **Universal gates:** Commands that apply to ALL stories (e.g., `pnpm typecheck`)
- **UI gates:** Commands that apply only to UI stories (e.g., browser verification)

**If no Quality Gates section exists:** Ask the user what commands should pass, or use a sensible default like `npm run typecheck`.

---

## Output Format

```json
{
  "project": "[Project name from PRD or directory]",
  "branchName": "ralph/[feature-name-kebab-case]",
  "description": "[Feature description from PRD]",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "[Story title]",
      "description": "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Criterion 1 from PRD",
        "Criterion 2 from PRD",
        "pnpm typecheck passes",
        "pnpm lint passes"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": "",
      "dependsOn": []
    },
    {
      "id": "US-002",
      "title": "[UI Story that depends on US-001]",
      "description": "...",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "...",
        "pnpm typecheck passes",
        "pnpm lint passes",
        "Verify in browser using dev-browser skill"
      ],
      "priority": 2,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": "",
      "dependsOn": ["US-001"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Story Size: The #1 Rule

**Each story must be completable in ONE ralph-tui iteration (~one agent context window).**

Ralph-tui spawns a fresh agent instance per iteration with no memory of previous work. If a story is too big, the agent runs out of context before finishing.

### Right-sized stories:
- Add a database column + migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic
- Add a filter dropdown to a list

### Too big (split these):
- "Build the entire dashboard" → Split into: schema, queries, UI components, filters
- "Add authentication" → Split into: schema, middleware, login UI, session handling
- "Refactor the API" → Split into one story per endpoint or pattern

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it's too big.

---

## Dependencies with `dependsOn`

Use the `dependsOn` array to specify which stories must complete first:

```json
{
  "id": "US-002",
  "title": "Create API endpoints",
  "dependsOn": ["US-001"],  // Won't be selected until US-001 passes
  ...
}
```

Ralph-tui will:
- Show US-002 as "blocked" until US-001 completes
- Never select US-002 for execution while US-001 is open
- Include "Prerequisites: US-001" in the prompt when working on US-002

**Correct dependency order:**
1. Schema/database changes (no dependencies)
2. Backend logic (depends on schema)
3. UI components (depends on backend)
4. Integration/polish (depends on UI)

---

## Acceptance Criteria: Quality Gates + Story-Specific

Each story's acceptance criteria should include:
1. **Story-specific criteria** from the PRD (what this story accomplishes)
2. **Quality gates** from the PRD's Quality Gates section (appended at the end)

### Good criteria (verifiable):
- "Add `status` column to tasks table with default 'open'"
- "Filter dropdown has options: All, Open, Closed"
- "Clicking delete shows confirmation dialog"

### Bad criteria (vague):
- ❌ "Works correctly"
- ❌ "User can do X easily"
- ❌ "Good UX"
- ❌ "Handles edge cases"

---

## Conversion Rules

1. **Extract Quality Gates** from PRD first
2. **Each user story → one JSON entry**
3. **IDs**: Sequential (US-001, US-002, etc.)
4. **Priority**: Based on dependency order (1 = highest)
5. **dependsOn**: Array of story IDs this story requires
6. **All stories**: `passes: false` and empty `notes`
7. **branchName**: Derive from feature name, kebab-case, prefixed with `ralph/`
8. **Acceptance criteria**: Story criteria + quality gates appended
9. **UI stories**: Also append UI-specific gates (browser verification)

---

## Output Location

Default: `./tasks/prd.json` (alongside the PRD markdown files)

This keeps all PRD-related files together in the `tasks/` directory.

Or specify a different path - ralph-tui will use it with:
```bash
ralph-tui run --prd ./path/to/prd.json
```

---

## Example

**Input PRD:**
```markdown
# PRD: Task Priority System

Add priority levels to tasks.

## Quality Gates

These commands must pass for every user story:
- `pnpm typecheck` - Type checking
- `pnpm lint` - Linting

For UI stories, also include:
- Verify in browser using dev-browser skill

## User Stories

## Running with ralph-tui

After creating prd.json:
```bash
ralph-tui run --prd ./tasks/prd.json
```

Ralph-tui will:
1. Load stories from prd.json
2. Select the highest-priority story with `passes: false` and no blocking dependencies
3. Generate a prompt with story details + acceptance criteria
4. Run the agent to implement the story
5. Mark `passes: true` on completion
6. Repeat until all stories pass
