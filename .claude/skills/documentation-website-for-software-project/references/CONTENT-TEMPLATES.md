# Content Templates + Rubric

Per-page-type skeletons and the rubric `scripts/content-lint.mjs` enforces. Use as starting structure; don't ship verbatim — prose should be custom to the project.

---

## The Polish Bar rubric (enforced)

Every page must pass:

| ID | Check | How `content-lint.mjs` tests |
|----|-------|------------------------------|
| P1 | **Intro paragraph** is ≥40 words before any heading | first non-frontmatter block length |
| P2 | **Motivation** stated before how-to | presence of one of: "why", "because", "motivated", "exists to", "solves", "we need", in first 300 words |
| P3 | **Mental model** present | at least one of: mermaid code fence, ASCII diagram in code block, `<FileTree>` / `<Cards>`, image |
| P4 | **Concrete example** present | at least one ``` fenced code block with a language tag |
| P5 | **Pitfalls / gotchas** present on any non-overview page | regex for `Callout type="warning\|error\|important"`, or heading containing "gotcha\|pitfall\|caveat\|common mistake" |
| P6 | **Cross-links** ≥2 internal (`](/...)` or relative `](../...)`) | count matches |
| P7 | **No TODO/placeholder** | no literal `TODO`, `XXX`, `FIXME`, `{{`, `lorem` |
| P8 | **Ends cleanly** (not mid-sentence, not trailing whitespace) | last non-empty line ends with `.`, `!`, `?`, `>`, `)`, `` ` ``, `|`, `]` |

Pages failing P1–P7 are flagged for Phase 4 rework.

## Template: Section overview (`content/<section>/overview.mdx`)

```mdx
---
title: <Section human name> — Overview
description: <one-sentence pitch pulled from phase1 executive summary>
---

# <Section human name>

<ONE OPENING PARAGRAPH (40-80 words): what this section covers, who it's for,
and how it fits into the rest of the project. Assume the reader has just landed
here from a Google search and has zero prior context.>

## Why it exists

<MOTIVATION: 2-4 sentences on the problem this part of the codebase solves.
Refer to life *before* this section existed, or to the alternative approach
that was rejected. Make it feel like a choice was made, not a default.>

## Mental model

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Caller] --> B[<Section name>]
  B --> C[(Downstream dependency)]
```

Think of <section> as <analogy>. The key moving parts are:

- **<Concept 1>** — <one-sentence role>
- **<Concept 2>** — <one-sentence role>
- **<Concept 3>** — <one-sentence role>

## A worked example

Here's a concrete scenario. <Describe a realistic input / command / request>:

```<lang>
<runnable code or command>
```

What happens under the hood:

1. <step 1 referencing `file.rs:line`>
2. <step 2>
3. <step 3>

## Where to go next

- [<Page A>](./<page-a>) — <why you'd read it>
- [<Page B>](./<page-b>) — <why you'd read it>
- [Architecture overview](../overview/architecture) — how this section fits into the whole

<Callout type="info">
  Reading tip: start with *<Page A>* if you're integrating this module; start
  with *<Page B>* if you're debugging it.
</Callout>
```

## Template: Module / concept deep-dive (`content/<section>/<module>.mdx`)

```mdx
---
title: <Module name>
description: <one-sentence description>
---

# <Module name>

<OPENING PARAGRAPH: what this module is, its public surface, and when you'd
reach for it (vs. sibling modules). Cite `file:line` to the entry point.>

## Responsibility

<2-3 sentences on the module's single responsibility. If it's hard to state in
2-3 sentences, the module probably has too many responsibilities — flag it for
Phase 10 improvement queue.>

## Public API

<Prefer a table over a dump. If you have lots of methods, group them.>

| Item | Signature | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `foo()` | `fn foo(x: &str) -> Result<Bar>` | <one-line> |
| `Baz`   | `pub struct Baz { ... }` | <one-line> |

## How it works

<NARRATIVE walk-through of the interesting code path. Not a repeat of the
source — an explanation of the *decisions*. Why is there a retry? Why is the
index a BTreeMap and not a HashMap? What would break if you changed it?>

### Step-by-step

<Use ### headings here; Phase 6 wraps them in `<Steps>`.>

### The tricky part

<Every module has one. Spell it out.>

## Example

```<lang>
<concrete, copy-pasteable example>
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Common mistake: <the foot-gun you'd warn a new hire about>.
</Callout>

## When to reach for it — and when not to

- **Use when:** <scenario>
- **Don't use when:** <scenario> — prefer [<alternative>](./<alternative>) instead

## Gotchas

- <gotcha 1>
- <gotcha 2>

scenario where you'd most commonly reach for it.>

## Synopsis

```sh
<tool> <command> [OPTIONS] <ARG>
```

## Example

```sh
<tool> <command> --flag value input.json
```

<Describe what the user sees: output format, exit code, side effects.>

## Flags

<GFM table, sorted by importance not alphabetically>

| Flag | Type | Default | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| `--flag` | `string` | `""` | <why you'd set it> |
| `--verbose` | `bool` | `false` | Adds `DEBUG`-level logs |

## Common workflows

### <workflow 1 name>

```sh
<commands, possibly multi-step>
```

### <workflow 2 name>

```sh
<commands>
```

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Generic failure (see stderr) |
| 2 | Bad arguments |

## Troubleshooting

- **"<error message>"** — <cause, fix>

## Template: Architecture / design doc (`content/overview/architecture.mdx`)

```mdx
---
title: Architecture
description: How <project>'s pieces fit together.

# Architecture

<OPENING PARAGRAPH: the project's architectural approach in one or two sentences
(e.g. "<project> is a layered CLI: a thin command parser that dispatches to a
core library, which persists state through a SQLite adapter."). Why this shape
and not another.>

## The big picture

```mermaid
graph TB
  subgraph "User-facing"
    CLI[CLI]
    API[HTTP API]
  end
  subgraph "Core"
    ROUTER[Dispatcher]
    DOMAIN[Domain logic]
  end
  subgraph "Storage"
    DB[(SQLite)]
    FS[Filesystem]
  end
  CLI --> ROUTER
  API --> ROUTER
  ROUTER --> DOMAIN
  DOMAIN --> DB
  DOMAIN --> FS
```

## Components

### <Component 1>
<paragraph: what it is, why it's its own component, key file:line refs>

### <Component 2>
<paragraph>

### <Component 3>
<paragraph>

## Cross-cutting concerns

### Configuration

<Where does config live? What's the precedence order? How is it tested?>

### Observability

<Logging conventions, structured events, metrics>

### Error handling

<Result types, error taxonomy, failure modes>

### Concurrency

<Runtime model, locking discipline, ordering guarantees>

## Non-goals

<Things <project> explicitly does NOT try to do. This is load-bearing for
onboarders — it stops them from looking for features that were never meant
to exist.>

# Security

<OPENING PARAGRAPH: who the system is defending against, what it explicitly does NOT defend against.>

## Threat model

| Threat | In-scope? | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| SQL injection | Yes | Parameterized queries throughout; see <reference> |
| XSS | Yes | All user input escaped by default |

description: Every configuration option for <project>.
---

# Configuration

<OPENING: where config is loaded from (priority order), override mechanism.>

## Sources (precedence, highest first)

1. Command-line flags (`--flag value`)
2. Environment variables (`PROJECT_SETTING_NAME`)
3. Config file (`./<project>.toml` or user-level)
4. Built-in defaults

## Complete reference

### `<section>`

#### `<section.key>`

- **Type**: `<type>`
- **Default**: `<default-value>`
- **Env var**: `<ENV_NAME>`
- **CLI flag**: `--<flag>`

<One-line purpose.>

**Example**:
```toml
[<section>]
<key> = <value>
```

<Repeat for every option.>

## Examples

### Minimal config

<just the required options>
```

### Production config

```toml
<sensible production defaults>
```

## Validation

```sh
<validation command>
```
```

## Anti-templates (things to NOT write)

- **Walls of autogen API** — put those in a sibling reference file under `<details>` or a collapsible section, keep the narrative page lean.
- **"Getting started" that's just "run this command"** — expand into 3 steps minimum, show the output, show what success looks like.
- **"Welcome to our docs"** home pages — hero with a one-line pitch + `<Cards>` beats a welcome paragraph every time.
- **Empty "Introduction" pages** — if `<section>/index.mdx` would just list its own children, use the section's `_meta.js` + a `<Cards>` grid on the parent index instead.
- **AI tells**: "In this comprehensive guide, we will explore...", "Let's dive in!", "It's important to note that...". The de-slopify skill catches these if run in Phase 4.
