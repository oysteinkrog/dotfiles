# Skill Bootstrap — Installing Referenced Skills via jsm

## Contents
- [Referenced-skill matrix](#the-referenced-skill-matrix) — full list with optional/required.
- [Detecting what's installed](#detecting-whats-installed) — pre-bootstrap inventory.
- [Installing via `jsm`](#installing-via-jsm-recommended-path) — installer, auth, subscription, install.
- [Installing via mirror / git clone](#installing-via-mirror--git-clone-no-jsm) — no-subscription fallback.
- [Graceful-degradation invariant](#the-graceful-degradation-invariant) — inline fallback per referenced skill.

## Overview

This skill composes many other skills. Before Phase 0 partitioning, check which are available and install the missing ones. If the user has a paid [jeffreys-skills.md](https://jeffreys-skills.md) subscription ($20/month), the `jsm` CLI can install any referenced skill in one command. If they don't, we gracefully degrade.

Don't block the run on this — skip missing skills and log them to `phase0_missing_skills.md` so the user can install them post-run.

## The referenced-skill matrix

Skills this documentation pipeline will invoke or cite if present:

| Skill | Phase used | Graceful fallback if missing |
|-------|-----------|------------------------------|
| `operationalizing-expertise` | structural | this file embeds the needed methodology inline |
| `codebase-archaeology` | Phase 1 | [AGENT-PROMPTS.md#phase-1](AGENT-PROMPTS.md#phase-1--section-research-agent) has the full prompt inline |
| `codebase-report` | Phase 1/3 | template is inlined in [CONTENT-TEMPLATES.md](CONTENT-TEMPLATES.md) |
| `ui-polish` | Phase 6c | use the prompt copy in [ADVANCED-NEXTRA.md](ADVANCED-NEXTRA.md) |
| `ux-audit` | Phase 6c / 10 | Nielsen heuristics list in [QUALITY-METRICS.md](QUALITY-METRICS.md) |
| `ubs` (ultimate bug scanner) | Phase 7 | `bun run build && bun run typecheck` only |
| `github` (gh skill) | Phase 8 | raw `gh` CLI commands in [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) |
| `vercel` | Phase 8 | raw `vercel` CLI commands in [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) |
| `idea-wizard` | Phase 10 | inline prompt in [AGENT-PROMPTS.md](AGENT-PROMPTS.md#phase-10--user-lens-agent) |
| `e2e-testing-for-webapps` | Phase 9 | Playwright smoke suite in [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md#c-playwright-smoke-tests-phase-9) |
| `og-share-images` | Phase 6 polish | Satori-safe pattern in [ADVANCED-NEXTRA.md](ADVANCED-NEXTRA.md) |
| `de-slopify` | Phase 4 polish | manual pattern list in [QUALITY-METRICS.md#ai-slop-patterns](QUALITY-METRICS.md) |
| `ru-multi-repo-workflow` | optional | raw `gh` + `git` commands suffice |
| `multi-pass-bug-hunting` | Phase 7 | the three fresh-eyes prompts are inlined |
| `gh-actions` | Phase 8 CI | workflow YAML in [DEPLOY.md#d-connecting-the-pipelines](DEPLOY.md#d-connecting-the-pipelines) |
| `agent-mail` | Phase 2/4 coordination | single-agent mode if missing |
| `beads-workflow` / `br` / `bv` | Phase 10 follow-ups | file GitHub issues instead |
| `ntm` | multi-agent orchestration | serial mode if missing |
| `cass` | research prior sessions | skip; doesn't block any phase |
| `readme-writing` | Phase 3 | inline patterns in [CONTENT-TEMPLATES.md](CONTENT-TEMPLATES.md) |
| `interactive-visualization-creator` | optional | mermaid + FileTree suffice |
| `tui-glamorous` | N/A for docs | — |

So even if only `bun` and `vercel` CLIs are installed, this skill runs end-to-end. Every referenced skill has an inline fallback.

## Detecting what's installed

```bash
# Run this before Phase 0 fan-out.
./scripts/check-skills.sh
```

It prints a table like:

```
skill                               status  location
---------------------------------   ------  ------------------------------------
codebase-archaeology                present ~/.claude/skills/codebase-archaeology
ui-polish                           missing (will install via jsm / fallback to inline)
idea-wizard                         present ~/.claude/skills/idea-wizard
...
```

and writes `phase0_skill_inventory.json` to the run workspace.

The script looks in:
- `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user-level)
- `$PROJECT/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project-level)
- Any additional path provided via `CLAUDE_SKILLS_PATH`

## Installing via `jsm` (recommended path)

### Is jsm installed?

```bash
command -v jsm >/dev/null && jsm --version || echo "jsm not installed"
```

If installed: skip to authentication.

### Install jsm

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://jeffreys-skills.md/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://jeffreys-skills.md/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer drops the binary at `~/.local/bin/jsm` (Unix) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\jsm\jsm.exe` (Windows). On a fresh Unix shell you may need to:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # add to .bashrc / .zshrc if missing
```

Verify:
```bash
jsm --version
jsm doctor        # non-destructive health check
jsm doctor --fix  # auto-repair config paths, PATH shims
jsm doctor        # re-run; should be clean except maybe auth
```

### Authenticate

`jsm` uses browser OAuth (Google sign-in) and stores encrypted credentials at `~/.config/jsm/credentials.enc`. Ask the user before launching a browser:

```bash
jsm login
# → prints a URL; user opens it, signs in with the Google account
#   tied to their jeffreys-skills.md subscription
```

Verify:
```bash
jsm whoami
# → should print the user's email and subscription tier
```

**Headless / SSH sessions:** `jsm login` opens a browser on the local machine. If you're SSHed in and a browser won't open automatically:

```bash
# Option 1: use an API key instead
jsm auth  # interactive prompt for API key (get from jeffreys-skills.md dashboard)

# Option 2: forward the auth URL to the user's laptop
jsm login --print-url
# → copy the URL, open it in a browser on any machine; credentials land back
#   on the headless box via the OAuth callback
```

**Credential encryption passphrase (non-interactive environments):**

```bash
export JSM_ALLOW_ENV_PASSPHRASE=1
export JSM_CREDENTIALS_PASSPHRASE='<your-passphrase>'
```

Only set this in session-local env; never commit.

### Subscription check

```bash
jsm whoami --json | jq -r '.subscription.status'
# → "active" (paid), "trial", "free", or "expired"
```

If not `active` and the user wants premium skills, direct them to https://jeffreys-skills.md — the subscription is $20/month and unlocks every skill in our reference matrix above.

### Install missing skills

Once authenticated:

```bash
# Install one
jsm install ui-polish

# Install with related/required deps
jsm install idea-wizard --related

# Bulk — install everything referenced by this skill
./scripts/install-referenced-skills.sh
```

`install-referenced-skills.sh` reads `phase0_skill_inventory.json` and runs `jsm install <name>` for every `missing` entry. It's idempotent (skips present ones via `jsm`'s own up-to-date check).

Installed skills land at `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` and are immediately available to Claude Code (no restart needed — skills are discovered per-invocation).

### What if jsm is installed but the user doesn't have a subscription?

`jsm install <skill>` on a free account only installs free/public skills. Premium ones return a `SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED` error. In that case:

1. Log the skill as missing in `phase0_missing_skills.md`.
2. Offer the user the option to subscribe (point them at https://jeffreys-skills.md).
3. Proceed with the inline fallback for that skill's role.

Do not pester the user repeatedly — one ask per run, then continue.

---

## Installing via mirror / git clone (no jsm)

If the user lacks `jsm` and doesn't want to install it, skills can sometimes be obtained from public mirrors:

```bash
# Example for a skill with a public repo
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/codebase-archaeology
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/codebase-archaeology \
  ~/.claude/skills/codebase-archaeology
```

The `research-software` skill (if available) can help discover current mirror URLs. If nothing is findable, the skill just isn't installed and the inline fallback runs.

---

## When in doubt — skip and log

Missing helper skills NEVER block a run. The pipeline logs them to `phase0_missing_skills.md`:

```markdown
# Missing helper skills (logged at <run-id>)

- `ui-polish` — used in Phase 6c for visual polish pass
  - fallback: inlined UI-polish prompt from references/ADVANCED-NEXTRA.md
- `og-share-images` — used in Phase 6 for OG image generation
  - fallback: copy the Satori pattern from references/ADVANCED-NEXTRA.md
- ...
```

The user sees this at run end and can decide to `jsm install` any of them for the next run.

---

## The graceful-degradation invariant

> **No phase of this skill should require any other skill to run.** Every referenced skill has an inline fallback in this repo. The referenced skills are *accelerants*, not prerequisites.

When writing new content in this skill, honor this invariant: every time you reference another skill, make sure the reader can still do the work without it.

---

## Agent Mail + Beads — the special cases

**Agent Mail** is strictly optional. If the user has the MCP server set up (`mcp-agent-mail`), Phase 2 and Phase 4 polishers use file reservations to avoid stomping on each other. Without Agent Mail, run those phases with one section per pass (serialized) to avoid conflicts. The phase prompts in [AGENT-PROMPTS.md](AGENT-PROMPTS.md) handle both cases by saying "reserve if agent-mail is available; otherwise proceed alone".

**Beads (`br` / `bv`)** is optional for Phase 10 follow-ups. If present, the user-lens agent files beads; if absent, open GitHub issues with `gh issue create`. Either way, follow-ups become tracked work, not stranded markdown.

---

## Script contracts (what scripts/check-skills.sh and scripts/install-referenced-skills.sh guarantee)

- Both scripts exit 0 even when skills are missing or jsm is absent; they print status and continue.
- They write `phase0_skill_inventory.json` with the shape:
  ```json
  {
    "checked_at": "2026-04-22T12:00:00Z",
    "jsm_available": true,
    "jsm_authenticated": true,
    "subscription_tier": "active",
    "skills": [
      {"name": "codebase-archaeology", "status": "present", "path": "/home/user/.claude/skills/codebase-archaeology"},
      {"name": "ui-polish", "status": "missing", "can_install_via_jsm": true},
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
- The main agent reads this file and decides per-skill whether to `jsm install` (user opt-in), use inline fallback, or skip.
