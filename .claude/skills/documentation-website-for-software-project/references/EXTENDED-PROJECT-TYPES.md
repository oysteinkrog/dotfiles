# Extended Project Types

[PROJECT-TYPES.md](PROJECT-TYPES.md) covered the common archetypes (Rust lib/CLI, Python lib/web, TS lib/CLI/monorepo, Go, SPA, backend, IaC, ML, polyglot). This file covers 10 more that come up often enough to deserve their own partition template.

Use the same pattern-matching approach from Phase 0: detect signals in the source repo, pick the template, record the choice in `phase0_project_type.md`.

## Embedded / firmware (C/C++, Rust for microcontrollers)

**Signals:** `Cargo.toml` with `#![no_std]`; `platformio.ini`; `zephyr.yml`; Makefiles with `-mcpu=`; hex/bin output artifacts.

**Audience:** mostly contributors and advanced operators. End-users are other firmware engineers.

## Updating the pattern-matching checklist

Extend the Phase 0 checklist from [PROJECT-TYPES.md](PROJECT-TYPES.md) with:

| Signal | Template |
|--------|----------|
| `#![no_std]` or `platformio.ini` | Embedded/firmware |
| `PROJECT` file + `config/crd/` | Kubernetes operator |
| WAL + B-tree/LSM in source | Database engine |
| Heavy `.md`/`.txt` docs, minimal code, formal grammar files | Protocol / spec |
| `manifest.json` with `content_scripts` | Browser extension |
| `Info.plist` or `pubspec.yaml` or RN `app.json` | Mobile app |
| Unity/Unreal/Godot project files, or asset pipeline code | Game engine |
| Jupyter notebooks + scipy/numpy deps + paper citations | Scientific computing |
| Multi-org CONTRIBUTING, meetings/ folder, CHARTER.md | Standards body |
| Solidity `.sol` + `audits/` + deployed addresses | Blockchain protocol |

Record the pick in `phase0_project_type.md` with a one-line justification.

---

## When none of these fit

Some projects don't match any archetype. That's fine — fall back to the generic template from [PROJECT-TYPES.md § Polyglot](PROJECT-TYPES.md#polyglot--multi-component-projects-eg-frontend--backend--cli) and customize.

If the new archetype is going to come up repeatedly (e.g., you're building docs for 5 similar projects in a row), add a new section to this file following the established pattern: signals, audience, partition, emphasis, grep list.
