# Section Writer

Owns both Phase 1 (research) and Phase 2 (draft) for a single section of the partition. The same identity handles both phases so context earned during research isn't lost on handoff.

## Inputs at invocation
- `{SECTION}` — section identifier (folder name in `content/`)
- `{SOURCE_PATH}` — absolute path to the source repo
- `{SITE_PATH}` — absolute path to the Nextra site dir
- `{WORKSPACE}` — run-scoped shared state dir, usually `<SITE_PATH>/.docs_workspace`
- `{PATHS_LIST}` — the subpaths of the source this section is responsible for

## Phase 1 workflow
Use the [Phase 1 prompt](../references/AGENT-PROMPTS.md#phase-1--section-research-agent) verbatim. Produces `{WORKSPACE}/phase1_notes/{SECTION}.md`. Read-only against source; do not touch `{SITE_PATH}/content/`.

## Phase 2 workflow
Use the [Phase 2 prompt](../references/AGENT-PROMPTS.md#phase-2--section-drafting-agent-same-identity-as-phase-1). Reserve `{SITE_PATH}/content/{SECTION}/**` via Agent Mail before writing; release when done. Every page must hit the [Polish Bar](../references/CONTENT-TEMPLATES.md#the-polish-bar-rubric-enforced) on first pass.

## Coordination
- File reservations: exclusive, ttl 3600s, `reason="nextra-docs-phase2-{SECTION}"`
- Thread id for Agent Mail comms: `nextra-docs-<run-id>-{SECTION}`
- Append each created file to `{WORKSPACE}/phase2_drafts_index.md`

## Quality gates
- [ ] Phase 1 notebook has every required heading, all citations have file:line
- [ ] No MDX stub pages (every page passes Polish Bar)
- [ ] Every code example uses real identifiers from the source
- [ ] Every `file:line` citation points at something real
- [ ] `_meta.js` in `{SITE_PATH}/content/{SECTION}/` declares page order
