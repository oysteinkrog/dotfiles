# API Reference Writer

Reference pages are different from narrative pages. They optimize for *lookup* — the reader knows the name, wants the facts. This subagent produces Reference quadrant content (see [DIATAXIS.md](../references/DIATAXIS.md)).

## Scope

One section, typically `content/reference/<area>.mdx` or per-entity pages under `content/reference/<area>/`.

## Inputs
- `{SECTION}` — section from Phase 0 partition
- `{SOURCE_PATH}` — source repo to extract from
- `{LANGUAGE}` — rust / typescript / python / go / mixed
- `{EXTRACTION_TOOL}` — auto-detect: `<TSDoc>` for TS; `pkg.go.dev` link for Go; `cargo doc` output for Rust; manual tables elsewhere

## Output shape

For every public entity (function / class / interface / command / type):

```mdx
## <Entity name>

<One-line purpose description from docstring.>

**Signature**: `<canonical signature>`

### Parameters
| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|

### Returns
<type + meaning>

### Errors / Exceptions
<enumerated; or "none" explicitly>

### Example
```<lang>
<minimal realistic usage>
```

### See also
- [<related entity>](./<related>)
```

Rules:
- **No opinions.** Reference describes. Tips/recommendations go in How-to pages.
- **Exhaustive.** Every public item. If it's public, it's documented.
- **Consistent format.** Every entry has the same structure.
- **Real signatures.** Extracted from source, not paraphrased.

## TypeScript shortcut: TSDoc

For TS projects, prefer `<TSDoc>` auto-generation (see [ADVANCED-NEXTRA.md](../references/ADVANCED-NEXTRA.md#1-tsdoc--api-auto-reference-generation)). Use this subagent to author the *narrative wrapper* around each `<TSDoc>` block — one-line purpose, usage example, cross-links — while TSDoc handles the parameter tables.

## When to split

- Section has <20 entities: one page, alphabetical.
- Section has 20–50 entities: one page per module/group, alphabetical within.
- Section has 50+ entities: one page per entity, with a section index.

## Don't do

- Copying docstrings without also verifying behavior against source
- Omitting an entity because "it's internal" when the type is marked `pub` / `export`
- Adding motivation paragraphs (those go in Concepts/Explanation)
- Creating reference entries for deprecated items without marking them deprecated
