description: Break large features into independently verifiable, human-reviewable slices under specs/<feature>/. Use for risky or multi-step feature work that needs upfront questioning, API seams, browser-playable checkpoints, HTML visualizations, screenshot gates, staged implementation plans, recursive fog-of-war reslicing, or proactive research into reference implementations/best practices before slicing. Pairs with your project's verification harness and screenshot gates (the browser checkpoints), [refactor-clean](../refactor-clean/SKILL.md) (review the materialized spec so the plan describes one-owner architecture, not the feature bolted on), [screenshot-critique](../../visual/screenshot-critique/SKILL.md) and [compare-screenshots](../../visual/compare-screenshots/SKILL.md) (the visual gates), and a code-review pass (audit each slice before it lands).

# Write Spec

Turn a large feature into a ladder of small contracts. Each rung should be
understandable to the human, testable by an agent, and useful before the
whole feature is done.

## First Principles

1. **Grill before planning.** Ask one question at a time until you know the
   desired outcome, non-goals, review surface, sacred contracts, missing
   assets, and first useful playable checkpoint. Give your recommended
   answer with each question so the user can accept, reject, or edit it.
   Inspect the repo instead of asking questions the code can answer.

2. **Slice at API seams.** Each slice should behave like a tiny library where
   possible: named module boundary, typed inputs/outputs, deterministic
   fixtures, and tests at the seam. If a slice needs three unrelated systems
   booted before it can be checked, sharpen the seam.

3. **Research the fog.** When the feature depends on an unfamiliar domain,
   high-fidelity visual target, named reference, benchmark, external repo,
   library, or "how do people usually do this?" question, do targeted online
   research before finalizing slices. Prefer primary sources: official docs,
   source repos, papers, case studies, talks, and shipped examples. If a
   reference implementation exists, add a replication spike before translation
   or approximation.

4. **Make progress visible.** For visual or interactive work, every slice
   should produce something playable: a route, fixture page, harness, CLI
   probe, or HTML visualization the human can run, inspect, screenshot, and
   critique. Tests prove contracts; demos expose taste and intent.

5. **Optimize feedback loops.** Slice so the next useful question can be
   answered quickly. Prefer tiny runnable surfaces, hot-reloadable harnesses,
   sample fixtures, and self-contained workbenches over plans that require the
   whole feature to exist before anyone can learn from it. For asset-heavy
   work, plan an asset app/workbench where humans and artists can add samples,
   upload replacements, preview them live, and see validation failures fast.

6. **Use the repo's natural shape.** If the repo is a monorepo, plan apps and
   packages instead of forcing everything into the current app. Give each
   testable surface a first-class route or command; avoid piling new behavior
   behind opaque query flags when a small dedicated app would be clearer.

7. **Do not block on missing inputs.** If art, data, credentials, or external
   assets are missing, plan generated placeholders plus a replacement contract.
   The feature should advance with placeholders, while a separate handoff path
   explains exactly what the human or external partner must provide later.

8. **Draft in parallel, then synthesize.** For any multi-slice feature, don't
   trust one pass to find the right cut. Fan out a few independent drafts and
   merge the best into one plan (see the Workflow). Divergence is the point —
   so engineer it on two axes: give each draft a different *bias* (a lens it
   optimizes for) and, when more than one model family is available, a mix of
   *models*. Blind, differently-biased drafts surface slices, seams, and risks
   a lone plan misses — and where they independently agree, you know the cut
   is solid.

9. **Recursively uncover fog of war.** The first slice graph is a scouting pass,
   not proof the field is known. After drafting, inspect each high-risk slice as
   if it were its own feature. If it hides multiple variables, unknown external
   practice, unproven architecture, or "we'll figure it out during
   implementation," reslice that subset and repeat until every next slice has
   one question, one seam, one review surface, and one verdict.

10. **One visual variable per slice.** Visual slices fail when they ask one pass
   to match the final hero image. Split by the thing being judged: density,
   silhouette, colour, texture, lighting, fog, water placement, water material,
   label legibility, animation rhythm. Each slice gets a crop/mask and a verdict
   for that variable only. Whole-frame comparison belongs at compose/integration,
   after the variables have their own evidence.

## Workflow

1. **Interview:** keep asking until you can name the slices without
   hand-waving. Stop when remaining unknowns can safely be discovered by the
   first slice.
2. **Research:** inspect the repo and research unfamiliar external practice
   before drafting when the feature names a reference, library, technique,
   standard, visual target, or performance pattern. Capture the discovered
   source/repo/article/paper links in the spec and turn any exemplar into a
   reproduction spike before a porting slice.
3. **Draft in parallel:** for a multi-slice feature, spawn **at least three
   independent subagents** to draft the whole plan — fresh context each, a git
   worktree apiece if they must run or build to validate, otherwise have them
   return the plan inline. Three is the floor, not the count: scale the pool
   with the feature's complexity, adding a drafter for each genuinely distinct
   approach or lens the problem supports. Give each the *same* brief from the
   interview and nothing else (never another draft) — but assign each a
   **distinct bias** so their divergence is structured, not accidental. The
   baseline trio:
   - **A — fewest-slices bias:** the smallest ladder that still ships; merge
     slices aggressively, question every rung.
   - **B — risk-first bias:** front-load the scariest unknowns; order slices so
     the plan dies fast if an assumption is wrong.
   - **C — seam-quality bias:** optimize API boundaries, ownership, and
     testability at each seam, even at the cost of more slices.

   Swap in or add lenses when the feature demands them (e.g. asset-pipeline
   bias, perf bias, migration-safety bias), but keep the biases orthogonal —
   grow the pool by adding a new lens, never by running the same lens twice.
   Also **mix model families**: if you're currently instructed to draft with
   codex, run at least one draft with claude — and vice versa — so the pool
   balances different models' blind spots, not just different prompts. Family
   means vendor (claude vs codex), not tier: every draft uses a
   state-of-the-art model; never diversify by dropping to a weaker tier of the
   same family. Each drafter: recon the real code and tests (measured facts,
   failed approaches, scope firewalls, greppable file/test names), then propose
   the slice graph, package/app boundaries, dependencies, API seams, playable
   deliverables, verification gates, and human review checkpoints. Skip the
   fan-out only for a genuinely single-slice problem.
4. **Synthesize:** read every draft and build the canonical plan yourself —
   don't anoint one. Take the strongest slicing, union the seams, risks, and
   firewalls each caught alone, and where drafts disagree pick the
   better-justified call and record the genuine alternative for the human. Where
   the drafts independently agree you're on firm ground; where they split is
   where to think hardest. When the feature has any visual surface, make
   [screenshot-critique](../../visual/screenshot-critique/SKILL.md) a standing
   verification gate in the README so every visual slice inherits it: the spec
   must tell the implementing agent to run an unbiased screenshot-critique as the
   last check on any visual shot before accepting it. Whenever a slice has
   something to compare its shot against — a prior look it changes, or a
   reference/inspiration image added for the feature — the spec must also name
   [compare-screenshots](../../visual/compare-screenshots/SKILL.md) as the gate
   that judges candidate-against-target: the telemetry and less-wrong verdict
   that screenshot-critique's single-shot eyes do not give.
5. **Recursive fog audit:** review the canonical graph slice by slice. For any
   slice with hidden variables, broad verbs ("make it realistic", "match the
   reference", "add the backend"), missing research, or more than one visual
   variable/API seam, run this same slicing logic on that slice as a sub-feature.
   Keep repeating until the next implementation slice can be accepted or rejected
   by one focused artifact. Record deferred variables as later slices, not prose
   inside the current slice.
6. **Materialize:** create `specs/<feature>/` when the feature has more than
   one slice or needs assets/visualizations.
7. **Refactor-clean the plan:** run [refactor-clean](../refactor-clean/SKILL.md)
   over the materialized spec — the plan is architecture too, and it must describe
   the shape the codebase would want if designed today, not the old shape with the
   feature bolted on. Name each concept that should have one owner (projection,
   environment, data contract, renderer phase, state machine, test oracle) and
   confirm no slice introduces a parallel abstraction, duplicated concept, or
   compatibility layer that a later slice must delete. Any transitional scaffolding
   a slice genuinely needs must be named as a short-lived seam with an explicit
   removal condition and the slice that removes it — collapsed the instant its
   consumers migrate, never carried to the end by default. Encode the resulting
   single-owner invariants and the end-state ("reads as designed today, not tacked
   on") in the README so every implementing pass inherits them.
8. **Build slice by slice:** leave each slice with a runnable artifact and
   verification before depending on it. Keep each artifact small enough to
   iterate on quickly. Keep the README's "Next Agent Prompt" written as the
   handoff text a future agent should read and follow.
9. **Reslice when the work says so:** if implementation hits a snag and the slice
   starts changing unrelated variables, stop broadening the patch. Update the spec
   first: split the slice into smaller contracts, name the frozen inputs, move the
   extra visual variables to later slices, and rewrite the Next Agent Prompt to
   resume from the first new slice. Then continue. Reslicing is progress, not
   failure.

## Plan Folder

Use `specs/<feature>.md` only for a small, single-slice problem. Large
features live in:

- `specs/<feature>/README.md` — goal, context, slice graph, review map,
  contracts, firewalls, known unknowns, and a "Next Agent Prompt" section with
  the current status, next pickup point, global TODO checklist, and handoff
  instructions for the next pass.
- `specs/<feature>/slices/<NN>-<name>.md` — one independently verifiable
  slice per file.
- `specs/<feature>/visualizations/*.html` — roadmap diagrams, prototypes,
  harness mockups, generated reports, contact sheets, or other
  human-reviewable artifacts.
- `specs/<feature>/assets/` — reference images, fixtures, captures, and other
  inputs needed to judge the work.

For visual work, keep feature-owned visual evidence in the spec folder:
inspiration images, reference screenshots, archived baselines, comparison
contact sheets, generated candidate captures, and critique artifacts. If those
files start outside the spec folder, copy them into the spec folder when they
become part of the feature's review context. Product snapshot folders may still
hold the active regression baselines their harnesses own, but do not rely on
those mutable outputs or external paths as the only record of what the feature
was judged against.

## Slice File Contract

Each slice file answers:

- What contract does this unlock?
- What is the API seam: module, functions/types, data shape, ownership?
- What can the human run or see?
- What tests, scenarios, screenshots, probes, or perf gates verify it?
- If the slice produces any visual shot (screenshot, GIF, contact sheet, or
  on-screen render), the slice file must instruct the implementing agent to run
  [screenshot-critique](../../visual/screenshot-critique/SKILL.md) as the last
  check before the slice is accepted — an unprimed second opinion the regression
  gates and the implementer's own inspection cannot supply. Write this as an
  explicit verification step in the slice, not as a passing mention.
- If the slice's shot has a target to compare against — a prior look it changes,
  or a reference/inspiration image added for the feature — the slice file must
  also instruct the agent to use
  [compare-screenshots](../../visual/compare-screenshots/SKILL.md) to judge
  candidate-against-target: telemetry plus a less-wrong verdict, not a check that
  the shot matches the reference. Write it as an explicit step too.
- For visual slices with a reference image, state the **slice variable** and the
  **crop/mask** used to judge it. Also list visible wrongness that is explicitly
  out of scope. Example: a grass-density slice compares lower-third coverage and
  falloff only; cliff shape, cliff texture, water, sky, and fog are later slices.
  A cliff-silhouette slice compares the ridge outline and depth rows only; rock
  texture and haze are later slices.
- What must stay green?
- What feedback from the human would change this slice?
- If the slice has a human review checkpoint, the slice file must frame it as
  **non-blocking**: tell the implementing agent to open the shots for the user
  with [preview-shots](../../visual/preview-shots/SKILL.md), give a short window
  (~5 min) for a response, and — if the user stays silent — decide on the
  evidence, record the decision and rationale in the spec, close the opened shots
  (preview-shots cleans up Preview, so an overnight run never piles up windows),
  and proceed. Implementation never stalls waiting on sign-off; the checkpoint is
  a chance to course-correct a reversible call, not a gate that blocks the build.

## README Handoff Prompt

Every multi-slice spec README needs a "Next Agent Prompt" near the top. Write it
in second person, as the prompt a future agent should read when they resume the
feature. The README should not merely describe that it is live handoff state;
the section itself must directly tell the next agent what to do next. It should
include:

- Current status and last-updated date.
- The exact next pickup point.
- Active blockers or warnings.
- A global TODO checklist, with each item pointing to the owning slice.
- A direct instruction to the next agent to update this section before ending
  their pass.

The point is that a fresh agent can open the README and know what to do next
without reading the chat.

## Done

The feature plan is done when a fresh agent can start at slice 1 without the
conversation, and the human can review the roadmap without reverse-engineering
a wall of text.

Once the slices have all shipped, [close-spec](../close-spec/SKILL.md) archives
the plan to `specs/done/` and rewrites it from a build ladder into a durable
rationale record.
