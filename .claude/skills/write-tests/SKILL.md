description: Write tests that pin real behavior instead of implementation details, config values, or lucky samples. Use when adding tests for new behavior, writing a regression test, fixing a brittle or flaky test, reviewing a test diff, or when a test breaks after a refactor or config change that didn't change behavior.

# Write Tests

A good test fails **only** when real behavior breaks, and passes through every
refactor or config change that preserves it. Most bad tests fail the opposite
way: red on harmless changes, green while the real path is broken. Every rule
below serves that one goal.

## Workflow: tracer bullets, not a batch

1. **Write ONE test at a time.** Assert first, watch it go red on the un-fixed
   code, make the code earn green, learn, then write the next. Never a batch up
   front: a batch written against *imagined* behavior pins what you guessed —
   those tests pass when the mechanism breaks and fail when it's fine. Each
   green cycle tells you what the next test should actually assert.
2. **Iterate on the fastest focused runner** (one file, one test name), and run
   the full suite only as a final gate before handing off. Check the exit code,
   not just the output — a runner that prints nothing and a green run look the
   same. On failures, read EVERY red test before fixing one; they often share a
   root cause.
3. **Before calling it done**, prove the test can fail (below) and walk the
   review checklist.

## What to assert

- **Observable behavior through the outermost practical entry point** — return
  values, exit codes, persisted rows, HTTP responses, rendered output — never
  which internal functions ran or how a value is computed. A test on the public
  surface survives a rewrite of everything underneath; a test that reaches into
  internals breaks on every refactor and pins implementation, not behavior.
  Reserve isolated unit tests for genuinely tricky pure logic (parsers,
  schedulers, state machines).
- **Nothing the compiler already guarantees.** A test that re-asserts a type
  signature — field shapes, rejected argument types — can only fail if the
  compiler failed first. Spend the budget on business rules, arithmetic,
  branching, ordering, edge cases, side effects.
- **Actual values, not collection sizes.** For dedup/normalize/idempotency
  paths, `length == 1` passes even when normalization is broken; also assert
  the stored value equals the expected canonical form.
- **The smallest scale that can show the behavior.** Two entities and one
  mechanism before crowds and integration; small tests fail fast with readable
  state and don't entangle five behaviors in one assert.
- **The design contract, not current behavior.** When a test goes red, the
  reflex is to re-measure and pin the new number — resist it: a bar calibrated
  to whatever the code currently does silently encodes bugs as baseline. Write
  the assert from the stated contract and make the code earn it; if no contract
  exists, that's a question for the owner, not a number to measure-and-pin.
  Recalibrating is legitimate only when the contract itself changed.
- **Deterministic claims tight, stochastic claims as distributions.** An
  invariant that holds every run gets an exact threshold. Anything noisy or
  tuning-dependent ("A usually beats B", "load balances evenly") must be
  asserted over a set of runs/seeds as a band — a single-sample pin on a
  stochastic outcome is not a weak test, it is a **blind** one: it certifies
  whatever the lucky sample did and can mask a systematic bias for months. If
  you must assert a noisy differential, widen the margin and name it
  chaos-marginal in a comment.

## Seams and mocks

- **Don't couple tests to config — mock the seam.** A test keyed to a live
  config value (which flag is on, which tier is default) breaks when someone
  legitimately edits config. The fix is never `skipIf`/conditionals — a skipped
  assertion hides the coupling and stops covering the path. Feed the function
  fixed inputs, or stub the lookup so fixture ids resolve to fixed values.
  Litmus: "would this break if a config value changed with no logic change?"
- **Don't over-mock — every mock is a frozen assumption.** Mock at the system's
  edges (network, clock, filesystem, third-party SDK, config lookup), never
  internal collaborators. Stubbing an internal hard-codes its current contract;
  refactor it and the test lies. Never make "was called with" the primary
  assertion when an observable outcome exists. Mocking three internal modules
  to test one function means: test one layer up, where they're real.
- **Harnesses must wire the system the way production does.** If a bug only
  showed up against a real environment, the harness skipped an input production
  always sets — fix the harness, don't just fix the bug.

## Control variables and probes

- **One variable per comparison.** Pin everything else — same seed, same
  counts, same configuration on both arms; disable mechanisms that aren't the
  subject. When a comparison test breaks, first ask whether an unrelated
  mechanism leaked into the experiment before touching the code under test.
- **Validate, don't assume.** Never reason your way to a conclusion about
  *cause* — which path fired, where the failures come from — and act on it.
  Write a throwaway probe that reads public state and prints; the plausible
  story is wrong often enough to burn a session, and one probe redirects the
  whole effort. Probes are scratch: put them where they cannot be committed,
  delete them the moment the question is answered, or promote them into a real
  test if the behavior deserves a permanent guard.

## Prove the test can fail

A test you never saw fail is decoration. For any regression test — especially
one written *after* the fix — falsify it once: revert or break the production
code the way the bug would, confirm red *for the expected reason*, restore,
confirm green. Verify the revert actually took: a stash or checkout with a
wrong pathspec reverts nothing, silently, and the "red" run quietly tests the
fixed code. The tell: the "red" numbers equal the green numbers.

## When a test goes red after a change

Triage in order of likelihood before editing anything:

1. The test encodes **deleted semantics** — it pinned an accident of the old
   implementation. Re-spec it to the contract's real claim.
2. The experiment **lost control of a variable** — a new mechanism leaks in.
   Pin the variable.
3. The **margin was chaos-tight**. Widen it, with a comment saying so.
4. The code is **actually wrong**. Probe the state, find the mechanism.

Never tune constants to make one test pass without rerunning the neighbors:
coupled systems reshuffle. If two consecutive tweaks each break different
tests, stop poking — the control surface is wrong; find the mechanism.

## Review checklist

Walk this on any test diff, apply fixes in the same pass, re-run the suite:

1. Does an assertion restate a type guarantee? → delete it.
2. Would it break on a config edit with no logic change, or is it
   `skipIf`-conditional on config? → mock the seam.
3. Are assertions mostly mocked-internal "called with"? → test a layer up
   against observable output.
4. Does it pin a single sample of a stochastic outcome? → assert a
   distribution.
5. Does it assert a count without the value on a dedup/normalize path? → add
   the value assertion.
6. Is the function under test still called in production? → if the only
   callers are tests, delete the function and the test together.
7. Can it fail for the right reason? → falsify once to confirm.
