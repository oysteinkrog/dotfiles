# Supervision And OTP-Style Design

If the target system has long-lived workers, stateful services, restart domains,
or named internal components, this is where Asupersync stops looking like a
Tokio replacement and starts looking like a stronger application model.

## Promote At The Right Time

Use this escalation path:

| Need | Prefer |
|------|--------|
| local concurrent step | `Scope` |
| single-owner mailbox state | `actor` |
| typed request/reply service | `GenServer` |
| application topology with restart policy | `AppSpec` + `supervision` |

Do not leave a real service topology encoded as loose tasks plus incidental channels.

## `AppSpec` Is The Real App Boundary

Use `AppSpec` when the process has:

- always-on internal services,
- restart domains,
- explicit startup ordering,
- registry-backed naming,
- coordinated stop/join behavior.

What it buys:

- compiled supervision topology before touching runtime state,
- deterministic child start order,
- root-region budgeting,
- optional registry capability injection,
- explicit `AppHandle` lifecycle.

Important guidance:

- Treat `AppHandle` as obligation-like. Resolve it with `stop` / `join`; do not casually drop it.
- Put caches, control loops, pumps, and replication workers under the app tree instead of creating them from request handlers.

Relevant paths:

- `src/app.rs`
- `examples/spork_minimal_supervised_app.rs`

## Supervision Strategy And Restart Policy

These are different decisions:

- `SupervisionStrategy` answers what happens to the failed child itself.
- `RestartPolicy` answers what happens to siblings and ordering relationships.

Use restart policy to encode dependency shape:

- `OneForOne` for independent children,
- `OneForAll` when siblings share critical state,
- `RestForOne` when later children depend on earlier ones.

Do not fake this with manual restart loops hidden inside children.

Relevant paths:

- `src/supervision.rs`
- `docs/spork_glossary_invariants.md`

## Designing `GenServer` Correctly

`GenServer` is not merely "actor but with call/cast."

Important semantics:

- `call` creates a reply obligation,
- `cast` does not,
- `on_start` and `on_stop` have distinct budgets,
- drain and `on_stop` run masked so cleanup completes deterministically,
- mailbox overflow policy is explicit via `CastOverflowPolicy`.

Design advice:

- use `call` when the protocol requires acknowledgement or ownership transfer,
- use `cast` only when fire-and-forget is actually acceptable,
- choose overflow policy deliberately,
- shape API and state transitions so stop/drain semantics are unsurprising.

Relevant paths:

- `src/gen_server.rs`
- `docs/spork_glossary_invariants.md`

## Registry And Name Leases

There is no ambient global registry.

Use registry capability when you need named internal services. Names behave like
leases:

- they must be released or aborted,
- they clean up deterministically on termination,
- they should not outlive the owning region.

Important guidance:

- inject registry capability through `AppSpec` / `Cx`,
- avoid rebuilding a global singleton service locator,
- resolve named handles explicitly with `stop_and_release()` or `abort_lease()` semantics.

Relevant paths:

- `src/cx/registry.rs`
- `src/app.rs`
- `src/gen_server.rs`
- `examples/spork_minimal_supervised_app.rs`

## Deterministic Ordering Matters

One hidden benefit of this layer is deterministic ordering for:

- child startup,
- restart behavior,
- registry cleanup,
- shutdown/drain sequencing,
- supervised trace analysis.

That is what makes "why did this worker restart before that one?" answerable from
artifacts rather than folklore.

Relevant paths:

- `docs/spork_deterministic_ordering.md`
- `docs/spork_glossary_invariants.md`

## Migration Rule

If a migrated service has:

- background task soup,
- shared mutable state hidden behind random channels,
- hand-rolled restart loops,
- ad hoc service discovery,

then promote it into `actor`, `GenServer`, or `AppSpec`/supervision instead of
trying to keep the old structure intact.
